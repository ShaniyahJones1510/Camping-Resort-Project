            <blockquote><p class="fixed">Manora Tree Stay's was founded by Shaniyah Jones in 2021. The name came from her love of nature and was originally 
                the name of her skin care business, but the name just fit better for her camping site! Shaniyah grew up in the heart (peach) of Georgia.
                 From a young age she was always fascinated with what goes on behind closed doors and that soon led her to want to connect with nature. While doing this,
                  she decided to start a skin care business with all organic products for those with sensitive skin just like her but, it never flourished. But then an amazing 
                  idea came to mind. She thought, "Why not invest in my own camping site?" and she did! Now she shows her love for nature by allowing others to enjoy her 9 acres
                   of beautiful land. And did I say her skincare business didn't flourish? What I actually meant was that it didn't flourish in the time that she was focused on it,
                    but now? It's a best seller at her camp site location! <br>
